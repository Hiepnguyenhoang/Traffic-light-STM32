# TESTING AND MAXIMIZING THE COMMUNICATION CAPABILITIES OF LPWA LORA

This project is developed by a team has four members
- Nguyễn Hoàng Hiệp
- Huỳnh Quang Đức
- Ngô Quang Đức
- Trần Anh Đức

## Objective

Test and Maximize the communication capabilities of the LoRaWAN protocol used Arduino under different real-world conditions: straight transmission (no obstacles), transmission through tree canopies, rain, and obstacles such as walls or buildings.

## Measurements method

## Hardware Requirements
- STM32 blue pill: 1 units
- button: 3 units
- LCD 1602: 1 units 
- LED (red, green, yellow): 3 units

## Connections
| Module LoRa | Arduino Uno R3 |
|-------------|----------------|
| VCC         | 3.3V           |
| GND         | GND            |
| RST         | 9              |
| DIO0        | 2              |
| NSS         | 10             |
| MOSI        | 11             |
| MISO        | 12             |
| SCK         | 13             |

## Measurement Scenarios
- Straight transmission: Measurement across both sides of West Lake (Hồ Tây)
- Transmission through tree canopies: The transmitter will be placed on top of a high-rise building while the receiver is under the tree canopy.
- Transmission with obstacles such as walls or buildings: Measurements will be taken across different floors of Nhà Xinh residential complex in Yên Hòa, Hanoi.
